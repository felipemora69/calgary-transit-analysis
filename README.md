#Retail Sales Analysis & Business Insights

**Project Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data using Python. It identifies key trends, evaluates product and customer performance, and highlights growth opportunities across channels and time periods.
The goal is to support data‑driven commercial decision‑making by transforming raw transactional data into clear, actionable insights.

**Business Objectives**

- Analyze overall sales performance and revenue trends
- Identify top‑performing and underperforming products
- Understand customer purchasing behavior and loyalty patterns
- Evaluate channel effectiveness and promotional impact
- Detect seasonality and time‑based performance shifts
- Support strategic decisions in sales, inventory, and marketing

**Key Insights Delivered**

- Month‑over‑month (MoM) and year‑over‑year (YoY) sales trends
- Product performance ranking and Pareto 80/20 distribution
- Customer segmentation and repeat‑purchase behavior
- Channel contribution and profitability
- Promotion vs. non‑promotion performance
- Revenue drivers and conversion patterns

**Technologies & Libraries**

- Python
- pandas — data cleaning & transformation
- numpy — numerical operations
- matplotlib — visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook — analysis environment

**Data Preparation**

The preprocessing workflow includes:
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing product and customer fields
- Creating time‑based features (month, year, season)
- Calculating KPIs (AOV, revenue, units sold, retention)
- Merging datasets for unified analysis
- Removing outliers and inconsistent records

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The analysis explores:
- Sales trends over time
- Product category performance
- Customer purchase frequency and loyalty
- Channel contribution and profitability
- Promotion vs. non‑promotion comparison
- Distribution analysis and outlier detection

**Visualizations**

Key charts included:
- Line charts for MoM & YoY trends
- Bar charts for product performance
- Pareto 80/20 distribution
- Heatmaps for seasonality
- Customer retention curves
- Channel comparison dashboards

**Results & Business Impact**

- Ridership rose pre‑2020, collapsed during COVID, recovered in 2022–23, then dipped in 2024 due to reduced immigration.
- CTrain rebounded faster downtown, while Bus ridership recovered more slowly in several neighborhoods.
- Seasonal peaks (summer, back‑to‑school) consistently drive higher ridership.
- LRT access is uneven: downtown is well‑served, while many outer neighborhoods rely almost entirely on buses.
- Recommendations: boost downtown commuting, expand service in underserved areas, align planning with population growth, prepare for future shocks, and continue LRT/BRT expansion.
